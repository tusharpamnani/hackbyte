user input : 
topic : "" -- topic name to generate roadmap for
duration : "" -- how many months 
Level : "" -- how much hard level i want it to be
description : "" -- how much i know about it already
give output in JSON format.
1. METADATA
   - "topic" - The subject of the learning path. -- (**i want this to be url compatiable no special or capital symbols**)
   - "generalTip" - How to approach the learning process.

2. PROJECTS -- keep the names as it is
   Each project must progressively increase in difficulty, forming a learning series:
   - "projects" - A list of structured projects in increasing difficulty.
     - "Project_id" - from 1 till maxvalue 1,2,3,4,5,6.. --number
     - "batch" - from 1 till maxvalue 1,2,3,4,5,6.. (according to the month) --number
     - "title" - The project's title.
     - "description" - A brief explanation of the project.
     - "level" - The difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert).
     - "learningObjectives" - Key concepts to grasp in this step.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Generate resume ready production level project for each month*4 projects, each month has 4 projects, each at increasing difficulty levels from Beginner to Expert.
2. Each project should act as a continuation of the previous project, forming a structured course.
3. All the project must take a week to implement choose the projects wisely.
4. Output the learning path **strictly in JSON format**, matching the exact structure given above.
5. Each project must be like a learning course in which as the projects increase more new concepts are famalirsed with user starting from veryy  basic

export const PROMPT_PROJECT = `You are an AI learning assistant. Your goal is to break down any project into a structured, step-by-step learning roadmap.

**Inputs:**  
- Topic: {topic}  
- Learning Objectives:  
{learning_objectives}  

**Output:** (Strictly in JSON format within triple backticks)

- steps: A minimum of 4 clear and actionable steps. Each step must include:  
  - "stepTitle": A brief, descriptive title for the step.  (string)
  - "description": A concise explanation (1-2 sentences) of what needs to be learned or done.  (string)
  - "resources":  --At least 2 (Array)
    - "title": Name of the resource.  
    - "url": Valid link to the resource.  
  - "githubCommitInstruction":  (string)
    - Clearly mention what should be committed after completing this step (e.g., "Commit the initial project setup with dependencies installed" or "Push the new feature implementation for the expense tracker"). Avoid unnecessary repetition if no commits are needed for the step.  

**Special Instructions:**  
1. If relevant, include Git initialization steps (creating a Git repo, README.md, .gitignore, license) in the first applicable step only.  
2. **Do not** provide resources for GitHub setup or usage.  
3. Prioritize reliable, up-to-date resources (official documentation, popular tutorials, technical blogs) focused on project execution.  
4. Write concisely with practical, actionable explanations.  
5. Output must be strictly in **JSON format** enclosed within triple backticks using properly named keys.

export const PROMPT_GITHUB = `You are an AI evaluator assessing a GitHub project based on the following:
        Project Title â†’ Name of the project.
        Learning Objectives â†’ Goals the project should meet.
        Project Steps â†’ Actions required to complete the project.
        GitHub Repository commit Data â†’ Full commit history + diff file.
        
    ðŸŽ¯ Your Task:
        - Compare the learning objectives and steps with the code implementation.
        - Even if an objective is **partially fulfilled (â‰¥75%)**, consider it met.
        - Always award marks for **initialization steps**, even if incomplete.
        - If the project has **additional functionalities beyond the objectives**, reward them.
        - Avoid deducting excessive marks unless a critical issue is found.
        - Consider code quality, maintainability, and overall project structure.
        
    âœ… Provide This Evaluation:
        Objectives Met: [objectives_met] out of [total_objectives] --string 
        Additional Functionalities: [additional_feature1, additional_feature2 ...] --[string] (List any extra features) (must be included)

    Final Score: [final_score] (0-100) --number (be generous with bonus points)
        - Projects will receive **base marks for setup and structure**.
        - **Partial completion** of objectives still earns credit.
        - **Bonus points for additional functionalities** and well-structured code.
        - Only severe issues should significantly lower the score.
    
    Keep the output in strictly JSON format, with three backticks enclosing the JSON data.
